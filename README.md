# music-management-scripts

A bunch of Python scripts to perform a few management tasks on the
files of a (my) local digital music library.

## Requirements

* Python 3
* [pytaglib](https://pypi.org/project/pytaglib/)
* [libtaglib](https://taglib.org) (required by pytaglib)
* [pathvalidate](https://pypi.org/project/pathvalidate/) (required by `create_toc.py`)

## General

Every script supports `-h` and `--help` that will print a list of arguments.
They should be self-explanatory.

## Show a file's tags (list-music-tags.py)

Supports single files or a recursive directory scan.

    python3 list-music-tags.py --src /somewhere/on/your/drive

The output will look like this for every file.

    ***************************************
    TAGS OF '06 Another fallen brother.m4a'
    ***************************************
    ALBUM       = Valkyrja
    ARTIST      = TÃ½r
    DATE        = 2013
    ENCODEDBY   = Nero AAC codec / 1.5.1.0
    GENRE       = Pagan Metal
    TITLE       = Another fallen brother
    TRACKNUMBER = 6
    Unsupported tag elements: ----:com.apple.iTunes:cdec; ----:com.apple.iTunes:iTunSMPB; covr

## Modify a file's tags (modify-music-tag.py)

Supports single files or a recursive directory scan.

    python3 modify-music-tag.py --src /somewhere/on/your/drive --artist Wolfheart --genre "Melodic Death Metal"

Supported tags are:

* Artist
* Album
* Title
* Genre
* Date
* Tracknumber

## Rearrange music files (rearrange-music.py)

Only works with a directory. Reads every file's tags and moves them to
a new location based on a naming scheme.

    python3 rearrange-music.py --src /somewhere/on/your/drive --dest /somewhere/else --format "{genre}/{artist}/{date} - {album}/{tracknumber} - {title}"

This script will move all the files to `/somewhere/else` and create a
folder structure that starts with the song's genre directly followed
by the artist. The album will contain the year, both tags separated by
a hyphen. Lastly, the track number and the song's title will be the
file's name. The track number will contain a leading zero to ensure
proper ordering at all times.

## Create Table of Contents (create-toc.py)

This script reads the content of a folder full of audio files and
parses the metadata from the file names. The assumption is that all
files in the folder are part of the same album or compilation and
follow a consistent naming scheme. The artist's name and album title
(or the equivalent of a compilation) must be the same for every file.

The purpose is for each folder to contain a JSON file, the TOC, or
table of contents that has the relevant metadata about an audio disc.
This way, the file names can be simplified and do not require any more
special encoding. This script helps to convert from my old naming
scheme to a more modern way. This includes getting rid of encoded 
characters like `&47;` for `/`, `&58;` for `:`, `&63;` for `?`, 
and `&92;` for `\`.

The `ToC.json` looks like this.

```json
{
  "artist": "Wolfheart",
  "album": "Winterborn",
  "genre": "Melodic Death Metal",
  "year": "2013",
  "tracks": [
    {
      "track": "01",
      "title": "The hunt",
      "filename": {
        "long": "Wolfheart#Winterborn#2013#Melodic Death Metal#01#The hunt.wav",
        "short": "01-The_hunt.wav"
      }
    },
    {
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

The original "long" filename is retained in case something goes wrong
during TOC creation and renaming from "long" to "short". This way, all
the information is still available.

The naming scheme can be configured using the `--format` argument.
The following types of tags are supported, separated by a comma. Not
all values are required, but you cannot specify more tags than are
available in the filename.

* artist
* album
* year
* genre
* track
* title

This way, you can configure the parser to your naming scheme. The tag
delimiter can be provided with `--delim`. The script only scans for a
specific file type that is identified by the file's extension. The
argument `--type` configures this extension. Note: do **not** include
the dot, e.g. use `-t wav` instead of `.wav`. This value is also used
for renaming the files.

    python3 create-toc.py -f "artist,album,year,genre,track,title" -s /home/rlo/Music -d "#" -r -t wav
